# Levi Ackerman

1) in the question it says that Levi Ackerman is a robot so I assumed there are robot crawlers that tell us what URL they can access.
2) I then changed the URL to  http://66.228.53.87:5000/robots.txt and a webpage came up

3) It says disallow /l3v1_4ck3rm4n.html so we go to that URL instead.
4) It gives the flag in the URL.
